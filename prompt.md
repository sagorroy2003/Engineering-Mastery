You are a senior full-stack engineer, DevOps architect, and technical educator.

I am building a public GitHub repository called "engineering-mastery".

Your task is to generate a complete, structured, professional learning repository from beginner to advanced level for:

"Full-Stack Mastery + DevOps Basics"

The repository must:
- Be production-quality documentation
- Be written clearly and professionally
- Be structured for step-by-step learning
- Include deep explanations (not shallow summaries)
- Include diagrams (ASCII if necessary)
- Include real-world workflows
- Include command examples
- Include best practices
- Include common mistakes
- Include interview questions
- Include practical exercises
- Include mini project suggestions
- Be suitable for public GitHub visibility so others can star and learn from it

First, generate the complete folder structure exactly as below:

engineering-mastery/
│
├── README.md
├── 01-git-core/
├── 02-github-platform/
├── 03-collaboration-workflows/
├── 04-backend-core/
├── 05-database-design/
├── 06-authentication-security/
├── 07-frontend-architecture/
├── 08-linux-fundamentals/
├── 09-docker-basics/
├── 10-ci-cd/
└── 11-deployment-guide/

Then create detailed markdown files inside each folder as described below.
